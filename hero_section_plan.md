# Hero Section Redesign Plan

## Analysis of Current vs Last Year Design

### Current Hero Section (from Home.tsx):
- Complex futuristic design with code-like styling
- Monospace fonts and terminal aesthetics
- Complex layout with stats, animations, and 3D elements
- Current button design: Terminal/command styled with "$" symbols
- Gradient backgrounds and cyberpunk color scheme

### Last Year Hero Section (from provided image):
- Simple, clean design
- Large title "TEXIBITION 2024"
- Subtitle "The Ultimate Tech Fest" in red/orange
- Date "27-28 JANUARY 2024"
- Description paragraph
- Simple "Register Now" and "More Info" buttons
- Logo/emblem on the right side
- Clean dark background

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Extract Last Year's Logo
- Create a simple logo/emblem similar to the one shown on the right side of last year's design
- Use similar styling with "TEXIBITION" text

### Step 2: Simplify Hero Section Layout
- Remove complex animations and 3D elements
- Remove terminal-style code snippets
- Remove stats section from hero
- Create clean, centered layout

### Step 3: Update Content
- Change title to "TEXIBITION 2K26" (updating year)
- Update subtitle to match style but current year
- Update date to "27-28 FEBRUARY 2026"
- Update description for current year
- Keep current button designs but adapt to simpler layout

### Step 4: Maintain Current Button Style
- Keep the existing button designs from current Home.tsx
- Terminal/command styled buttons with gradients
- Maintain hover effects and animations

### Step 5: Background and Styling
- Use cleaner background (remove complex grid patterns)
- Maintain dark theme but simplify visual elements
- Keep some gradient effects but make them subtler

## Expected Outcome
A hero section that combines:
- Last year's clean, simple layout
- Current year's updated content and branding
- Current button styling and interactions
- Simplified but professional appearance
